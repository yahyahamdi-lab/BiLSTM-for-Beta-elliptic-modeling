# BiLSTM-for-Beta-elliptic-modeling
We propose a new online handwriting trajectory modeling by simulating the beta-elliptical [1] approach to limit the calculation time and to have an end-to-end description system meeting the needs of mobile device users. The developed model deploys a multi-stage architecture based deep learned recurrent neural network (RNN) with bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) that simulates the process of extracting the dynamic and geometric parameters composing the beta-elliptical vector. This architecture encompasses the pre-processing, segmentation, and approximation steps of the trajectory in its two velocity and geometric profiles and is traced by only neural computation sequences.

- For Evaluation, we have used ADAB dataset [2] for online Arabic handwriting words.
